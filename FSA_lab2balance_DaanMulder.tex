\section*{Balance}

\subsection*{Exercise 6}
For exercise 6, we implement the Balance game in a similar way to the Mastermind implementation. The secret is a list of $n$ Coins, which can be Light or Normal (Heavy was not implemented to make it easier to avoid situations where several options cannot be distinguished, such as [Light,Normal,Normal] and [Normal,Heavy,Heavy]). Guesses can be made with a list of $n$ scale positions (either left, right or off the scale). \texttt{reaction} then adds the weights for each side (1 for a Light Coin and 2 for a Normal Coin) and gives the appropriate feedback.

Both Knuth's minimax strategy (\texttt{exercise6a}) and the `maximize entropy' strategy (\texttt{exercise6b}) were implemented, though in tests they always behaved the same.
